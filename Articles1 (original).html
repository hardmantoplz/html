							As the sound engineer and audio/visual tech at my church, I’ve found that connecting multiple monitors to our presentation system was a challenge.  Not because it can’t be done, but because we didn’t have a budget.  So I had to find a way to do it cheap as possible and still work.  

							With 2 video inputs, a video camera and a pc,  I needed a HDMI <a href="https://sewelldirect.com/sewell-crossbolt-hdmi-2x1-multi-viewer-with-pip-">switch</a> and HDMI <a href="https://sewelldirect.com/hdmi-1x4-splitter">splitter</a> in order to get 4 tv’s synced with two projectors and one monitor to all work together, and a live stream computer feed.  I have two 1x4 HDMI splitters when I really should have a 1x8 HDMI splitter, but I built it to test if the first would work.  Then we wanted another so one is connected to the other to give me 7 outputs. Plus there are more options with 2 splitters as I can have them in different locations if needed. One projector called the Main Sanctuary and the 2nd monitor only needed the PC input. So that means I also needed a <a href="https://www.newegg.com/Product/Product.aspx?Item=9SIAC1251B0006&cm_re=vga_splitter-_-9SIAC1251B0006-_-Product">VGA splitter</a>, fortunately we had one.  The diagram shows the system components and connections.  The connections between the splitter and tv’s are accomplished with HDMI to cat5 <a href="https://sewelldirect.com/hdlink-hdmi-over-single-cat5-extender">converters</a>. 
							<br> <br> 

							To get the livestream. We had to purchase a HDMI to USB video converter.  This one by <a href="http://amzn.to/2khUwjK">Magwell</a>

							works great but is was $300.  All the cables I build from bulk which saved a little, but not much since cables are pretty cheap now.  I use a <a href="https://www.amazon.com/Vertical-Cat5e-Patch-Panel-Bracket/dp/B01DQ1LC8S/ref=sr_1_5?ie=UTF8&qid=1485981626&sr=8-5&keywords=cat5+patch+bay">patch bay</a> to bring all the ethercon to one place and use small patch cables to connect the cat5 converters.  I build this system a little at a time.  It works great and cost very little compared to a pro system.  You can easily spend $4000 doing this stuff with pro gear.  I figure its in the neighborhood of around 5-6 hundred dollars in gear and cables.  TV's, monitors, projectors, cams, and computer not included in the price.

						Recently I was generously given a 20” <a href="https://support.apple.com/kb/SP507?locale=en_US&viewlocale=en_US">iMac</a> (A2266).  I wasn’t sure how much it could be updated.  Much to my surprise, it was easily updated and inexpensively.  The first thing was to update the RAM from 1Gig to 4Gig ($26.59).  That made a dramatic improvement in the boot time and app opening speed. 
								<br>
								     Downloading and updating some newer apps proved to be difficult with out of date OS X 10.5.8.  I was having no luck downloading <a href="http://apple.co/2kRtPWj">Snow Leopard</a> (10.6) from the internet and the CD for my Macbook pro didn’t work either.  After a very short chat with an Apple tech, I found out that I needed to buy a copy of Snow Leopard from Apple for $19.99.  So that was easy enough.  Once that was installed, I could download the newest OS from the Apple App store.
		
							<h1>Time for the SSD</h1>
								    <p id="p">I also wanted to upgrade the hard drive to an SSD.  I bought a <a href="http://www.crucial.com">Crucial</a> 120Gig SSD ($64.99) since I don’t need a lot of storage and I have plenty of external drives. Using <a href="http://bit.ly/2ks5fub">iFixit</a> the tutorial was easy to follow and install.   That was the most technical part since, I had to take the computer apart.  It was pretty easy to do and I had the special tools to unscrew the special screws (be prepared).  You can find all the tools at the iFixit tutorial.  It's recommended to use an adapter to mount the SSD that is 2.5 in a 3.5 bay($12.99).  That is found <a href="http://amzn.to/2kh7z58">here</a>.  I just taped the SSD with electrical tape along with the temp sensor that was on the old HD.  I used some foam to fill the remaining space.  I have ordered the adapter that I will install when it gets here to make it more complete.</p>
	
								<h1>Overview</h1>
								   <p id="p"> Once I had all the parts and software it took some time (half a day) but for around $120 I have an up to date computer that is really quite fast.  It's not a retina screen but its fine for my usage (surfing the net, emailing, music, etc).  I would like to add a <a href="http://apple.co/2jXPJpr">Magic Trackpad 2</a> in the future.

															<p id="p"> About a year ago I purchased a <a href="https://www.crucial.com">Crucial</a> CT480 M500 <a href="http://bit.ly/1jTRduU">SSD drive</a> to replace my original 250GB 5400-rpm SATA hard drive in my <a href="http://www.apple.com/macbook-pro/">MacBook Pro</a> (13-inch, Mid 2010).  I must say with the help of <a href="https://www.ifixit.com">IFIXIT</a> the install went pretty easy but took a few hours with the install of the software and the physical install.  It only took about a half hour for the hardware part but the software part was a bit slow.  Using a boot disk duplication software for my Mac it was easy to just clone my old drive.  You can do the same for a PC as well.  Here is some free software for this on a <a href="https://superduper.en.softonic.com/mac">Mac</a> or <a href="http://bit.ly/2jDs5uI">PC</a>.  Right away it fired up and I’ve been using it ever since.  I did buy a <a href="http://bit.ly/2kr5ZjT">enclosure</a> for my old drive and it is now a back up.    <h1>Faster booting and accessing</h1><p id="p">I have to say the my Macbook Pro boots twice as fast or faster and the apps open quicker too. All in all it was a good time to upgrade to a larger drive and the speed was a bonus since my 250GB original drive was starting to get pretty full with pictures, video, and too many apps. IFIXIT is a great resource for many types of technical upgrading and repairing.  They have great video and step by step photo help.  I’ve used their site a couple of times and it worked out perfectly. You can do this modification with most computers and the IFIXIT site has the information you need depending on your device. 
								     So I won’t go into the play by play of how I did it since the information can be found on the IFIXIT site just click on the link. As for the Crucial drive itself I’ve had no trouble so far with it, I have enabled the <a href="http://bit.ly/2ksmtrc">TRIM</a> feature that is supposed to help with limiting the read and write cycles on the drive to prolong the life of the drive.  I understand that the Samsung SSD drives are probably the best and they are a little more pricey, but I'm not disappointed by the Crucial.

															<p id="p">Online storage is cheap and/or free, there's a ton of options.  <a href="https://www.godaddy.com/email/online-storage.aspx">GoDaddy</a> offers 100Gb for $2.50-1.99/Month depending on the length of time you pay for it.  That's pretty cheap.  You should definitely be taking advantage of all the free storage out there like Google <a href="https://www.google.com/drive/">gDrive</a> and <a href="http://www.dropbox.com">Dropbox</a>.   <ahref="https://onedrive.live.com/">Microsoft</a> has online storage as well.  Using <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201318">iCloud</a> you get 5 GB free then there are upgradable plans from there for a fee.  You can use PC or a Mac with all these options including iCloud.  I have all these mentioned here except GoDaddy.  
							<h1>Photo options</h1>
													<p id="p">I like the google gDrive because it offers a lot of storage and syncing of documents as well as real time collaboration multiple person live editing of documents.  <a href="https://support.apple.com/en-us/HT201318">Flickr</a> is also another option for photos that is pretty good too and offers plenty of storage but, its photos and videos only and googles version of that is <a href="https://picasa.google.com">Picasa</a>.  This is only scratching the surface of what is out there for online storage.  I suggest taking advantage of the google gDrive and the Dropbox for sure and if you need more then explore the options depending on your needs.<h1>Use in combinations</h1>
													<p id="p">One of the reasons to have this type of storage is so you can access your files from any computer you happen to be using.  Provided you remember your login credentials.  I like using the Flickr for photos, gDrive for personal and non-personal collaboration work.  gDrive is good for photos as well.  Dropbox is the first one I started with.  At that time you could get more storage just for recommending it to someone with a link that gave you more storage if they signed up using your link.  I ended up with 50GB's.  Basically, if you want to say, back up your entire computer you will likely have to pay for some type of service that has enough storage and is designed for full system backup.  There are plenty of options at a reasonable cost.  I back up on a physical hard drive but a online backup is not a bad idea if you are serious about having multiple back ups in different locations as is recommended by experts.  One back up is not really serious safety if it all burns up in a fire or something.  It's best to have many full system backup in many locations if you really want to be sure you can recover everything in a catastrophic failure scenario.

							Ok so I broke down and built a PC.  Using info from <a href="http://easypcbuilder.com">easypcbuilder</a>.  Since I won't be gaming, I got the plans to make their least expensive model.  It’s an engineered parts build.  I must say its a very snappy computer.  Although I’m still not crazy about Microsoft software the windows 7 OS seems to be working pretty well.  It was a fun build and pretty easy.  Sometimes you need to have both mac and PC for certain applications and I believe this setup is going to work well for years to come and it’s upgradeable I can make the necessary changes to update and upgrade as technology changes.  I bought everything from <a href="https://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> and for $600 its great.  As a bonus I added some LEDs to the case for lighting since the case has a window to the guts inside.  I also bought a <a href="https://www.monoprice.com/product?p_id=14861">Phillips monitor</a> that has a great picture and was only $99.

							The <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org">Raspberry Pi</a> is a cool little computer that has several configurations. It’s great for any type of computer users.  If your a kid who wants to play games and learn to program, it can do that for about $35.  It can be a server, bitcoin miner, if you like to tinker with GPIO pin outs and setting up a host of different control devices the Raspberry Pi can do that too.  If you just want to watch movies and TV you can also get that done with a Pi using <a href="https://kodi.tv">Kodi</a> and <a href="https://osmc.tv">OSMC</a>. You can surf the web and check email as well.  As for the operating system, you have to use an SD card and put the image file on it so that it boots the computer.  The Pi comes as a bare bones motherboard and there are endless types of cases for them.  <a href="https://www.adafruit.com/search?q=raspberry+pi&b=1">Adafruit</a> is a great resource for pi accessories.  <a href="http://www.element14.com/community/community/raspberry-pi?ICID=menubar_topics_rpi">Element 14</a> is also a good place to find accessories.  There is a magazine that has all sorts of useful information that is free online to help you learn more called <a href="https://www.raspberrypi.org/magpi/">MagPi</a>.

							<p id="p">For the money you can’t beat it and you will find something cool to do with it.  I have 3 PI's. I use one for a media center and the other is used for different purposes depending on the operating system I load up.  Sometimes I use it for just a light weight computer other times I use it to play music like pandora as a radio.  The third is used for retro video games.  The computer was designed to teach kids programming for very little cost.  It's definitely worth a look and very inexpensive to experiment with.  Here is a good place to get it, <a href="http://www.newark.com/buy-raspberry-pi?rd=rasperry+pi+3&selectedCategoryId=&categoryNameResp=All%2BCategories&searchView=table">Newark</a>.

<a href="https://www.canva.com">Canva</a> is a web graphic design site that I have been using for a while and I have to say it is awesome!  It is simple to use with a lot of free graphics as well as the ability to upload your own images.  Some of the graphics cost ($1/ea) and are very high quality, but it's not necessary to do that.  It is a great site for developing websites, presentations, banners, business cards, posters, etc.  There are many tutorials as well as templates for gift cards and a host of other social media background templates too. 
<br><br>
<p id="p">After creating your project then you can download them.  They are PNG files but can be easily converted to JPG files or any other.  To do that,  I use <a href="http://www.zamzar.com">Zamzar</a> a free online converter.  Try playing around with Canva.  The sign up is free and everything is saved online so you can sign on using any computer and all you work is there.  I use several accounts so that I can keep everything separated and work from anywhere on any computer.  Its a lot of fun just to play with if you like graphic and design work.  Check it out and have fun creating background for your Facebook, Twitter, YouTube and any other social media customizable sites you have.  Kids will probably enjoy its ease of use as well.  If your not a very artsy person and you need help with element of design work <a href="http://bit.ly/2krnT5Y">CreativeMarket</a> may help with color schemes and texture								<br><br>
